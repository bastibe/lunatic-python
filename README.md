This is a fork of Lunatic Python, which can be found on the 'net at http://labix.org/lunatic-python.

Sadly, Lunatic Python is very much outdated and won't work with either a current Python or Lua.

This is an updated version of lunatic-python that works with Python 2.7 and Lua 5.1.
I tried contacting the original author of Lunatic Python, but got no response.

Installing
----------

To install, you will need to have the Python and Lua development libraries on your system. If you
do, use the recommended methods (```pip```, ```easy-install```, etc) to install lunatic-python.

This version has been modified to compile under Ubuntu. I haven't tested it under other
distributions, your mileage may vary.
